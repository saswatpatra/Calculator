# Calculator in Multiple Programming Languages üî¢

This repository contains simple calculator implementations in various programming languages. The goal is to compare how different languages handle basic arithmetic operations and to showcase the differences in syntax, structure, and ease of use.

## Purpose üéØ
The primary purpose of this repository is:
- To demonstrate how to build a calculator in different programming languages.
- To highlight the similarities and differences between languages like **C**, **C++**, **Python**, and **Java**.
- To serve as a part of my portfolio, showcasing my learning journey as I explore different programming languages during my Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) degree.

## Why This Project? üí°
As part of my BCA studies, I am learning new programming languages, and creating a calculator is one of the simplest and most common tasks for beginners in each language. This repository not only tracks what I have learned, but also serves as a practical example of my growing proficiency in various languages. Through this project, I aim to:
- Demonstrate my understanding of basic programming concepts across different languages.
- Compare the syntax and functionality of multiple programming languages.
- Share my progress and knowledge as I continue to explore more languages.

## Languages Covered üåç
1. **C**  
   A structured, low-level language known for its manual memory management and strict syntax.  
   [View Code](./C/calculator.c) | [Run Code](https://www.programiz.com/online-compiler/4G446UqiJNqG0)
   
2. **C++**  
   An extension of C that introduces object-oriented programming. It balances performance with more flexibility.  
   [View Code](./C++/calculator.cpp) | [Run Code](https://www.programiz.com/online-compiler/33aaB27yNJFuz)
   
3. **Python**  
   A high-level, interpreted language known for its simplicity and readability. It's dynamically typed and perfect for beginners.  
   [View Code](./Python/calculator.py) | [Run Code](https://www.programiz.com/online-compiler/9tHHaPJLBMvIA)
   
4. **Java**  
   An object-oriented, platform-independent language, often used for large-scale applications. It has more verbose syntax compared to others.

## Comparison and Explanation üìä
You can find detailed comparisons of each language's calculator implementation in the [DIFFERENCES.md](./DIFFERENCES.md) file. Here, I explain:
- How syntax varies across languages.
- Which language is easier to use for this task.
- Performance considerations.
- Readability and flexibility differences.

## Getting Started üöÄ
To run the calculator in any language, follow the instructions below:

- **C**: Compile using a C compiler (`gcc calculator.c -o calculator`) and run `./calculator`.
- **C++**: Compile using a C++ compiler (`g++ calculator.cpp -o calculator`) and run `./calculator`.
- **Python**: Run `python calculator.py` in your terminal.
- **Java**: Compile using `javac calculator.java` and run using `java calculator`.
